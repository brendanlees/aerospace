# Aerospace Config

My personal config/documentation for [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace). Intended to be used alongside [Raycast](https://raycast.com) and [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/)) for a nice workflow.

## Controlling windows and layout with Aerospace

- Everything is mostly standard and [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) like, but with some mods for certain apps to have dedicated spaces.

## Controlling apps and functions with Raycast

- In Raycast, key apps/functions have their own action key shortcuts (using option/alt) - ie. `alt+a=Claude`
- Any Raycast extension commands related to these apps/functions have key shortcuts set as modifiers of the initial action key - ie. `alt+shift+a=GPT`

## Controlling 'top-bar' related apps and functions with Bartender

- In Bartender, key topbar apps/functions have their own action key shortcuts as well, but all are prefixed with ctrl+alt - ie. `ctrl+alt+c=ItsyCal`
- This is handy, as you can assign commands to show/hide some applications in a different way than possible with just Raycast.
