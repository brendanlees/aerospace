# Another Aerospace Config

My personal config/documentation for [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace). 

Intended to be used alongside [Raycast](https://raycast.com) and [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) for a nice workflow.

### Window Management (Aerospace)

Everything is mostly standard and [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) like, but with some mods for certain apps to have dedicated spaces.

---
### Apps And Functions (Raycast)

In Raycast, key apps/functions have their own action key shortcuts (using option/alt) - ie. `alt+a=Claude`

Any Raycast extension commands related to these apps/functions have key shortcuts set as modifiers of the initial action key - ie. `alt+shift+a=GPT`

---
### 'Top-bar' Apps and Functions (Bartender)

In Bartender, key topbar apps/functions have their own action key shortcuts as well, but all are prefixed with ctrl+alt - ie. `ctrl+alt+c=ItsyCal`

This is handy, as you can assign commands to show/hide some applications in a different way than possible with just Raycast.
